# Stalled PR Close Policies

Two PR-only close reasons handle external pull requests that stop making
progress: `stalled_unproven_pr` and `abandoned_pr`. Both are review-proposed
and apply-guarded like every other close reason: review records the proposal,
and apply re-checks live GitHub state immediately before any mutation.

Both reasons are for non-maintainer pull requests only. Maintainer-authored
PRs, protected labels, and the standard exemption labels
(`clawsweeper:human-review`, `clawsweeper:manual-only`, `clawsweeper:autofix`,
`clawsweeper:automerge`) always block them.

## `stalled_unproven_pr`

An external PR was asked for real-behavior proof, the ask expired, and the
branch is low-rated and idle.

Review may propose it only when all of these hold:

- `realBehaviorProof.status` is `missing`, `mock_only`, or `insufficient`;
- `prRating.overallTier` is `D` or `F`;
- the proof requirement is visible on the PR (ClawSweeper review comment,
  proof nudge, or a needs-proof label).

Apply additionally verifies live state:

- the PR is older than 14 days and its current head has no source-triggered
  workflow run associated with that pull request created in the last 14 days.
  This immutable run creation time counts a push of an old commit as fresh
  activity without letting later CI reruns reset the clock. A force-push event
  targeting the current head also resets the clock; missing source-activity
  data keeps the PR open;
- a dated proof request is visible on the PR — a needs-proof label timeline
  event or a proof-nudge comment — and that request is at least 14 days old,
  so the contributor had a real window to respond. The durable review comment
  is edited in place and cannot date the ask, so it does not count;
- the PR is not a draft (drafts route to `abandoned_pr` instead);
- no `proof: sufficient` or `proof: override` label is present;
- no human engagement: no assignee, requested reviewer/team, or
  maintainer comment/review/inline comment.

The close comment names the missing proof kind and invites reopening with a
live run, logs, or a reproducible validation transcript. The
[proof-nudge lane](proof-nudges.md) remains the polite warning step and still
never closes anything itself.

## `abandoned_pr`

An external PR has clearly been abandoned in a non-landable state.

Review may propose it for stalled external PRs, but not for high-quality
proven work: an `S`/`A`/`B` overall rating with sufficient or overridden proof
blocks the reason because that work belongs in repair/adopt paths.

Apply additionally verifies live state:

- the PR is older than 30 days and its current head has no source-triggered
  workflow run associated with that pull request created in the last 30 days,
  using the same push-safe, rerun-stable inactivity clock as
  `stalled_unproven_pr`;
- the live PR is still stalled: a draft, labeled
  `status: ⏳ waiting on author`, or failing checks
  (combined status failure/error, or a check run concluding
  `failure`/`timed_out`) on its current head;
- no human engagement, same checks as above.

The close comment acknowledges the useful part of the work, states the
observed inactivity window and stalled state, and invites a rebased reopen or
a fresh PR with green checks.

## Failure posture

Live-state probes run through safe wrappers: if any GitHub read fails, the
apply run records a skip reason and keeps the PR open. Snapshot drift rules
still apply — any new commit, comment, or label change since the review blocks
the close until a fresh review confirms the proposal.
