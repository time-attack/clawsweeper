# Action Ledger

ClawSweeper's durable action history is an immutable, privacy-bounded event
store. Mutable comments, dashboard rows, CrabFleet sessions, router ledgers,
and latest-report files are projections of that history, not the source of
truth.

Writers first spool individual events locally:

```text
.clawsweeper-repair/action-events/<repo-slug>-<repo-digest>/<event-id>.json
```

The repository digest prevents collisions between repositories whose readable
slugs are identical. Readers also verify that every event's repository and
event ID reproduce its exact spool path.

At job finalization, the spool is sorted, deduplicated, and published as one or
more immutable JSONL shards:

```text
ledger/v1/events/YYYY/MM/DD/<producer-repo>/<producer>/<run-id>-<attempt>-<job>-<digest>-part-<index>-of-<count>.jsonl
```

Per-job shards avoid a shared append hotspot while preventing one Git commit per
event. CrabFleet receives live structured events; the state ledger receives the
canonical finalized shards. A failed live CrabFleet projection records a
retryable `projection.failed` event in those shards, so delivery outages cannot
erase or block the authoritative action history. Projection requests have a
bounded deadline, abort on timeout, and cancel response bodies after every HTTP
response.

## Identity And Replay

Each event carries five correlation fields in addition to `event_key`:

- `operation_id` is stable for one logical review, command, repair, apply,
  operation, or evidence-binding lifecycle across retries and workflow reruns.
- `attempt_id` identifies one execution attempt inside that operation.
- `parent_event_id` links causal transitions and is `null` for a root event.
- `phase_seq` is the caller-assigned phase ordinal inside an attempt. Parallel
  branches may share an ordinal and use parent links to preserve causality.
- `idempotency_key_sha256` identifies the external side effect independently of
  event and attempt identity, so retries can be observed without authorizing a
  duplicate mutation.

`event_key` identifies one recorded transition within an attempt. Runtime
writers derive it from attempt ID, phase sequence, and stable transition
identity. Only machine-readable scopes and SHA-256 digests are stored; raw
identity fields are not:

- item source revision plus review phase;
- comment ID, comment version, command, and dispatch phase;
- repair job, source head, action, and execution phase;
- decision packet digest, target revision, and apply phase;
- notification event key and delivery target;
- Gitcrawl snapshot ID, query, and evidence-binding phase.

`actionOperationId`, `actionAttemptId`, and `actionIdempotencyKey` canonicalize
and hash their inputs. Identity inputs must be plain canonical JSON trees:
non-finite, negative-zero, or unsafe-integer numbers, dates, class instances,
sparse or decorated arrays, accessors, `undefined`, functions, symbols,
bigints, cycles, and credential-bearing field aliases are rejected before
hashing. Canonical JSON validation is iterative and rejects inputs deeper than
64 levels, larger than 10000 nodes, or larger than a 1 MiB UTF-8 input budget
before recursive normalization or hashing. Ledger object keys and evidence use locale-independent UTF-8 byte
ordering without changing the older shared `stableJson` contract. Integer-like
keys retain byte ordering rather than JavaScript property enumeration order,
and unpaired-surrogate keys are rejected. Large identifiers must be strings.
`event_id` is the SHA-256 of normalized repository plus `event_key`. Callers
cannot supply a raw event key, and event-key scope prefixes pass the same
confidential-identifier checks as every other durable machine-text field.

- Replaying the same key and semantic payload is idempotent.
- Reusing a key for different semantic content is a hard conflict.
- Retrying an operation creates a new `attempt_id` and new event records while
  preserving `operation_id` and mutation idempotency keys.
- Mutation events require an explicit business `idempotencyIdentity`; outcome
  status and failure reason never define side-effect identity.
- Repository, producer SHA, workflow, job, run, attempt, and component all bind
  shard identity. They do not define the logical operation.
- Workflow, step, invocation, and component identifiers keep a readable prefix
  plus a digest of the original value whenever sanitization or truncation loses
  information, so distinct producer identities cannot collapse. Workflow refs
  split at the rightmost exact `@refs/` delimiter, preserving `@` characters in
  workflow filenames.
- `recorded_at` is first-writer metadata and is excluded from event and shard
  replay equality. When equivalent fresh-root reconstructions reach an existing
  shard or import destination, the existing first-writer bytes win.
- `occurred_at_source` distinguishes caller-supplied source timestamps from
  writer-generated clock metadata. The semantic digest binds source timestamps
  and the source/generated marker, so chronology cannot be downgraded without
  invalidating the event. Generated occurrence and recording clocks remain
  first-writer metadata, so equivalent fresh-root reconstruction cannot conflict
  solely because another writer observed a different wall clock. An explicitly
  supplied empty timestamp is invalid source evidence; only an omitted value
  selects the generated clock.
- Shard line order is a deterministic topological order: causal children follow
  their in-shard parents. Independent source-timestamp events use occurrence
  time and event ID as stable tie-breakers; generated-clock events use stable
  provenance and event ID so wall-clock drift cannot reverse replay order.
- Shard partition dates come from
  `CLAWSWEEPER_ACTION_LEDGER_PARTITION_DATE` or immutable
  `GITHUB_RUN_STARTED_AT` metadata. The producer-specific marker is persisted
  before its first event, and finalization only reads that marker. Wall clock,
  the current flush environment, and event ordering are never used, so delayed
  or fresh-root reconstruction cannot move a run to another path. Timestamp
  metadata must round-trip through a real calendar date; impossible dates are
  rejected rather than normalized into another partition. Four-digit years
  `0001` through `0099` remain valid and are not remapped by JavaScript's
  legacy `Date.UTC` year handling. Timezone conversion must also remain within
  UTC partition years `0001` through `9999`.
- Shards are deterministically packed in canonical event order. Every output
  stays at or below 1024 events and 2 MiB, matching importer limits. Reusing a
  numbered run/job shard part for different content is a hard conflict.
- Shard path components remain below portable 255-byte filename limits.
  Overlong readable repository, producer, run, or job components are truncated
  with a hash suffix; the full normalized identity still binds the shard digest.
- Spool, shard, partition-marker, and import writes require a pre-existing
  trusted root. The supplied root pathname must already be absolute and
  canonical, and its native real path must be identical, so roots reached
  through symlinks or junctions are rejected. Callers create and permission this
  root before invoking the ledger. Finalization validates caller and environment
  output-root strings in that original form before any path normalization.
- Under that trusted-root model, writers create descendant directories one
  component at a time and reject links or special entries. Final files are
  hard-linked create-only from a fully written and fsynced sibling staging file,
  then the destination directory is fsynced where supported. A crash can leave
  a regular `.tmp` staging file but never publishes a partial final shard;
  replay safely publishes the canonical file. Staging names are ignored by
  readers, while symlinks, directories, and special entries fail closed.
- Parent-chain, inode, real-path, descriptor, and final-path checks are
  defense-in-depth corruption and replacement detection. Portable Node v1 does
  not claim containment against a process that can concurrently rename or swap
  the trusted root or its ancestors: Node does not expose the handle-relative
  `openat`, `linkat`, and `unlinkat` operations needed to enforce that boundary.
  Such hostile concurrent filesystem mutation is outside the v1 threat model
  and must be prevented with workspace ownership and process isolation.
- Multi-step readers retain one validated root identity from enumeration through
  file parsing. Root, parent-chain, descriptor, and final-path identities are
  rechecked around reads. File opens are nonblocking before descriptor type
  validation, so replacing a validated regular file with a FIFO cannot hang the
  process.
- Shard imports begin at `ledger/v1/events`; unrelated source-tree entries are
  never traversed. Links and special entries inside that subtree fail closed.
  Imports cap relative depth at 6, directory entries at 512, directories at 512,
  files at 256, each shard at 2 MiB, 2048 lines, and 1024 events, and each batch
  at 16 MiB and at most 262144 events from the bounded file-by-event product.
  Every source shard is read once, then the complete bounded batch is parsed and
  canonicalized before any final destination shard is published. Event IDs and
  causal topology are validated across the complete batch, so duplicates and
  cycles cannot hide across files. Numbered parts are grouped by their full
  producer/run identity, flattened in part order, and required to reproduce the
  exact deterministic packing, paths, and bytes that the canonical writer would
  emit.
- Import reservations bind each producer run to one partition and each event ID
  to one semantic digest and parent edge. Parent traversal follows at most
  262144 durable bindings per import and rejects instead of accepting an
  unchecked deeper graph. These bindings preserve global event identity and
  causal acyclicity across sequential producer imports.
- Producer and event reservations are published before shard payloads so a
  replay can safely finish an interrupted import. Complete shard-set manifests
  are published only after every destination payload has been written and
  reread as replay-equivalent. Sequential imports therefore cannot move a run,
  replace a complete numbered set with a different part count, or advertise a
  complete set whose payload publication did not finish.

## Privacy Boundary

The ledger stores machine-readable reason codes, counts, booleans, hashes,
bounded subject IDs, relative report paths, public run URLs, and snapshot IDs.
It does not store prompts, bodies, comments, diffs, patches, raw logs, raw
payloads, arbitrary model text, local absolute paths, credentials, private
hosts, or email addresses. Credential detection covers GitHub token families,
JWT-shaped values, Basic credentials, whitespace or separator-delimited
bearer/API/Cloudflare credential forms, credential field aliases, POSIX and
Windows absolute paths, case-insensitive private paths, private IPv4 and IPv6
addresses, and internal hostname suffixes. Form-style `+` credential separators
are rejected when followed by a credential-shaped value. Percent-encoded octets
are rejected from durable identifiers and paths rather than decoded into
potentially confidential forms. URL checks normalize scheme-specific paths,
userinfo, file URLs, numeric URL host aliases, shorthand private IPv4 URLs such
as `127.1`, and dot-segment paths. Host checks normalize case, repeated trailing
root dots, and compressed IPv6 loopback and private IPv4-embedded forms,
including partially compressed forms embedded in unbracketed machine text,
while all durable text remains restricted to field-specific machine
vocabularies.

Every event records a privacy classification, redaction version, and fields
dropped. The checked-in JSON schema is
[`schema/state-ledger-event.schema.json`](../schema/state-ledger-event.schema.json).

## Event Families

The shared taxonomy defines six families:

1. **Review**: batch, item, retry, log publication, and comment publication.
2. **Command**: receive, classify, claim refresh, progress, wait, requeue, and
   recovery.
3. **Repair**: intake, dispatch, plan, execute, validate, review, publish,
   post-flight, requeue, recovery, and queue phases. Blocked and failed summary
   types remain available for coarse emitters.
4. **Apply**: individual action, batch, and publication phases.
5. **Operations**: workflow attempts; dispatch, retry, and queue lifecycles;
   notification delivery; publication, status, dashboard, and session
   lifecycles; cancellation and projection failures.
6. **Evidence**: Gitcrawl snapshot, query, and binding phases plus proof stage
   and binding phases.

This taxonomy is a schema foundation, not a claim that every lane already emits
every phase. Lanes can migrate independently without changing the v1 shard
format.

New writers should prefer phase-oriented types from
`ACTION_EVENT_PHASE_TYPES`, statuses from `ACTION_EVENT_STATUSES`, and optional
reasons from `ACTION_EVENT_REASON_CODES`. The event type identifies what phase
ran; `action.status` identifies its transition or outcome. Free-form detail
belongs in neither field.

```ts
recordWorkflowPhaseEvent(root, {
  phase: ACTION_EVENT_PHASE_TYPES.repairValidate,
  status: ACTION_EVENT_STATUSES.completed,
  reasonCode: ACTION_EVENT_REASON_CODES.completed,
  operation: "repair",
  operationIdentity: { queueItemId },
  attemptIdentity: { queueItemId, attempt: 2 },
  parentEventId: executeEvent.event_id,
  phaseSeq: 4,
  idempotencyIdentity: { queueItemId, validationRevision },
  identity: { queueItemId, sourceRevision },
  component: "repair_validate",
  subject: {
    repository,
    kind: "queue_item",
    subjectId: queueItemId,
    sourceRevision,
  },
  retryable: false,
  mutation: false,
  attributes: {
    validation_count: 3,
    validation_kind: "focused",
  },
});
```

`recordWorkflowPhaseEvent` derives `scope`, `event_type`, `action.name`, and
the phase transition identity. It rejects unknown phase, status, and reason
strings at runtime. `recordWorkflowActionEvent` remains the compatibility API
for existing v1 emitters and previously published shards.

Subjects support issue, pull request, cluster, command, workflow, repository,
notification, commit, queue item, deployment, and publication identities.
Attributes remain allowlisted, scalar, collection-bounded, and
privacy-checked.

## Projections

Consumers fold immutable events into purpose-specific views:

- the marker-backed GitHub review comment shows a bounded review history;
- `results/comment-router.json` shows current command state;
- CrabFleet shows live sessions and structured events;
- the ClawSweeper dashboard shows current status and timing;
- notification ledgers track external delivery;
- evidence graphs bind review and apply claims to GitHub and Gitcrawl sources.

`CLAWSWEEPER_CRABFLEET_TIMEOUT_MS` sets the live projection deadline in
milliseconds. It defaults to 10000 and must be between 1 and 60000. Timeout,
HTTP, and response-cleanup failures remain projection failures; canonical local
writes are completed first. Live delivery runs at most four fetches concurrently
with 64 more projections queued. A timed-out fetch keeps its concurrency slot
until the underlying request and response-body cleanup settle; a later wave
fails closed into durable retryable `projection.failed` records if all slots
remain unresolved. Queued projections snapshot their endpoint, session, token,
and timeout before admission, so later environment mutation cannot reroute
them. Further live projections also fail closed instead of growing process
memory without bound.

Projection configuration is also optional and non-authoritative. Once the local
event is durable, malformed URL or timeout settings, incomplete session
credentials, and registration-provenance mismatches are converted into a
redacted retryable `projection.failed` event instead of escaping into the review
or repair workflow.

`CLAWSWEEPER_CRABFLEET_URL` remains a configurable credential-free HTTPS base
and defaults to `https://crabfleet.openclaw.ai`. Projection derives the trusted
base from the session-scoped `CLAWSWEEPER_CRABFLEET_WORK_STATE_URL` returned by
registration, requires the configured base and registered session route to
match, and only then attaches the bearer token. This preserves staging and
self-hosted CrabFleet deployments while rejecting later environment-origin or
base-path drift. Queued projections retain that validated base even if the
process environment changes after admission.

Projection rebuilds must be deterministic. Truncating a projection never
deletes source events. State-side compactors may replace hot shards with
digest-verified monthly segments after the configured retention window.

## Migration

Each lane migrates by dual-writing its legacy projection and immutable events.
Readers continue accepting legacy state until the corresponding event backfill
and projection parity checks are complete. Close and merge eligibility remains
bound to current live guards; an event is historical evidence, not permission
to mutate GitHub.
