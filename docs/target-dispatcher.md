# Target Repository Dispatcher

`openclaw/clawsweeper` cannot receive native `issues` or `pull_request` events
from sibling repositories directly. Target repositories should forward those
events with `repository_dispatch` so ClawSweeper can run a single-job exact
one-item review, sync the durable review comment, and immediately apply a safe
close proposal for that same item.

This document covers issue and PR item dispatch. Commit review dispatch is
documented separately in [commit-dispatcher.md](commit-dispatcher.md). A target
repository can keep the two lanes in separate workflow files or combine them in
one `.github/workflows/clawsweeper-dispatch.yml`; `openclaw/openclaw` uses the
combined form.

General GitHub activity can also be forwarded to the OpenClaw-backed activity
ingest lane with `repository_dispatch` type `github_activity`. That lane does
not run ClawSweeper review/apply; it feeds compact activity to the agent, which
posts to `#clawsweeper` only when the event is surprising or actionable. See
[openclaw-event-hooks.md](openclaw-event-hooks.md#github-activity-stream).

For issue and PR dispatch, copy this workflow into each target repository as
`.github/workflows/clawsweeper-dispatch.yml`, or merge these triggers and the
`Dispatch exact ClawSweeper review` step into an existing combined dispatcher:

Target repositories no longer need a TypeScript profile before exact event
review can run. Any installed `openclaw/*` repository that is not denied in
`config/target-repositories.json` uses the conservative generic profile:
issues stay open, and PRs can auto-close only when already implemented on
`main`. Add a config entry only when the repo should appear in the dashboard or
needs repo-specific review guidance.

Exact event reviews enable related issue GitHub Search by default so newly
opened issues get stronger duplicate and adjacent-report context. Set repository
variable `CLAWSWEEPER_RELATED_GITHUB_SEARCH=0` on `openclaw/clawsweeper` to turn
that enrichment off without editing the target dispatcher.

Before enabling the workflow:

1. Install the `clawsweeper` GitHub App on the target repository.
2. Add the App private key as the target repository Actions secret
   `CLAWSWEEPER_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
3. Install exactly one target dispatcher. Do not add separate comment, spam, and
   generic-activity dispatch workflows that forward the same event twice.
4. Keep the target write token limited to the comment acknowledgement path.
   Issue/PR review dispatch only needs the ClawSweeper installation token.

Comments are a lightweight trigger only when the body contains a ClawSweeper
command, and generated proof-nudge comments are explicitly ignored before command
matching. The target workflow reacts with `eyes` and creates one visible queued
status comment for maintainer-authored commands when target write permission is
available, but both acknowledgement writes are best-effort. It must still dispatch
`clawsweeper_comment` to the comment router when acknowledgement or queued-comment
creation gets a target-repository 403. The dispatch carries the exact source
comment id and, when available, the queued status comment id. The router edits
that queued comment in place instead of posting a second reply.
Exact comment dispatches scan only that comment and use a per-comment receiver
concurrency group, so one maintainer command does not wait behind an unrelated
command on the same repository. The scheduled sweep remains a five-minute
fallback. Bot-authored label churn is also ignored. Human
Label changes never directly trigger an exact review. Content-changing events
such as issue edits and PR synchronizes update the desired review revision. The
receiver coalesces by repository and item number, then dispatches only a leased
executor for the newest revision.

For sub-5s acknowledgement, use the GitHub App webhook receiver instead of
waiting for GitHub Actions to start the target dispatcher. The hosted Worker
endpoint is `/github/webhook`; the local equivalent is
`pnpm run build:repair && pnpm run repair:comment-webhook`. It verifies
`CLAWSWEEPER_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, accepts eligible public `openclaw/*` and
`steipete/*` `issue_comment`, `issues`, and `pull_request` events, mints a
target installation token for acknowledgement/comment reactions, mints the
`openclaw/clawsweeper` installation token for repository dispatch, and queues
exact `clawsweeper_comment` or `clawsweeper_item` work. The durable Worker
queue dispatches at most 32 leased exact-review executors. Keep the Actions
dispatcher installed as a compatibility fallback; its legacy dispatch is
bridged into the same queue before Codex starts.

The receiver keeps the review lane proposal-only, then runs exact apply for the
selected item with only immediate-safe close reasons enabled:
`implemented_on_main` and `duplicate_or_superseded`. Normal scheduled apply
still handles the broader backlog, with `stale_insufficient_info` and
`mostly_implemented_on_main` blocked until the item is at least 60 days old.

`openclaw/clawhub` dispatches are intentionally skipped while the receiver
variable `CLAWSWEEPER_ENABLE_CLAWHUB` is not `1`. Enable it only after the
ClawSweeper GitHub App is installed on `openclaw/clawhub`; otherwise the
receiver cannot mint the target read/write tokens.

The event job creates only a target read token before Codex runs. The target
write token and the repository push token are introduced after Codex exits, and
the same `apply-decisions` guard path still re-fetches the item before any
comment or close mutation.

## Rate-limit-safe CI setup

Install one dispatcher workflow per target repository. Keep the event fanout
inside that workflow; do not add separate comment, spam, or generic-activity
dispatch workflows in the target repository.

The full dispatcher example above is the copy-pasteable job definition. Its
important rate-limit properties are:

```yaml
name: ClawSweeper Dispatch

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened, edited, labeled, unlabeled]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, ready_for_review, edited, labeled, unlabeled]

permissions:
  contents: read

concurrency:
  group: clawsweeper-dispatch-${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.issue.number || github.event.pull_request.number || github.run_id }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event.action == 'edited' || github.event.action == 'synchronize' || github.event.action == 'ready_for_review' }}
```

The job mints one short-lived `clawsweeper` App token scoped to
`openclaw/clawsweeper`, then sends one `clawsweeper_item` or
`clawsweeper_comment` `repository_dispatch`. For comments, the
`Pre-filter ClawSweeper comment` step runs before the target write token is
minted, so ordinary comments consume neither a target installation token nor a
dispatch. The prefilter is only an ingress guard: `/clawsweeper` may carry any
supported subcommand, while `/review`, `/autoclose`, and `/auto-merge` (with
spaces or tabs allowed between `auto` and `merge`) are the standalone aliases.
The router remains authoritative. Do not use a PAT or dispatch the same comment
through both the exact router and a second spam/generic workflow.

To verify a target installation, open a pull request or issue and confirm one
`ClawSweeper Dispatch` run. Add a maintainer comment containing `@clawsweeper`
or a supported slash command and confirm one `clawsweeper_comment` dispatch.
An ordinary comment should produce no ClawSweeper comment dispatch and no
target-token step. If the target app secret is absent, the workflow should
finish with a notice rather than fall back to a maintainer PAT.

The ClawSweeper `github-activity` workflow performs spam-candidate
classification in-process and only dispatches the scanner for an accepted
candidate. This keeps ordinary comments to one activity run instead of an
activity run plus a second intake workflow. Preserve the source delivery or
comment id in every payload so receiver-side deduplication can collapse
redeliveries.
