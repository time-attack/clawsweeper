# OpenClaw Bay Demo

OpenClaw Bay is an experimental, read-only visualisation of the live
ClawSweeper pipeline. It lives at `/bay-demo` on the existing dashboard Worker
and turns active work into animated crustaceans moving across a shoreline.

[Watch the 32-second browser recording](openclaw-bay-demo.mp4). It shows the
live populated shoreline, master-sweeper movement between lanes, terminal
pools, and the contextual crustacean chat behavior. The recording is a
1280×720 H.264 review artifact with audio and capture metadata removed.

For independently inspectable interaction proof, see the
[labelled Playwright storyboard](proof/openclaw-bay/playwright-proof-storyboard.jpg),
[compact trace](proof/openclaw-bay/trace.zip), and
[machine-readable assertion summary](proof/openclaw-bay/proof-summary.json).
That deterministic run uses the real page and artwork with a fully synthetic,
redacted status sequence; it covers the forward sweep, retrigger tunnel,
search, repository filter, safe drawer links, local-only tide, and visible
network diagnostics without reading live dashboard data.

The demo is intentionally absent from the Overview, issue-triage, and PR-proof
navigation. `X-Robots-Tag` and page metadata ask crawlers not to index it, but
that is not access control: anyone who has or guesses the URL can open it. A
maintainer-only preview would require Cloudflare Access or application
authentication as a separate rollout decision.

## What It Shows

The five active lanes group the current worker state into:

- Arriving
- Setting up
- Reviewing
- Repairing
- Applying

An item that advances raises a ready flag before the master sweeper moves it to
the next reported lane. Any observed new run for the same GitHub item is
represented by a tunnel, even when polling first sees that run in the same or a
later lane. Completed, failed, and cancelled pools contain only explicit
terminal evidence; a disappearing worker is never treated as successful.
Because the completed-job evidence cache can trail the active feed, a worker
that disappears remains in its last lane as **CHECKING** for up to 150 seconds.
It is swept into a terminal pool only when explicit outcome evidence arrives.

The terminal buffer is deliberately small. At 20 proved outcomes, the tide
animation clears the visible pools. The Durable Object record retains fewer
than 20 buffered outcomes, the most recent 20 washed outcomes, and at most 256
seen event identifiers under the existing seven-day event TTL. Stored content
is rewritten only when that bounded state changes. If an item is retriggered,
its prior terminal record no longer counts toward the visible tide while its
event identifier remains deduplicated. The Preview tide button changes only the
browser animation and does not mutate stored state.

Repository filters and **Where's my crustacean?** operate entirely on the
current snapshot. Selecting a crustacean opens the same GitHub and workflow-run
links exposed by the source worker data.

## Data And GitHub API Load

Bay is a presentation over the existing cache-backed `/api/status` snapshot.
It adds no browser-to-GitHub requests and no new GitHub REST or GraphQL query
path. Active work, explicit terminal outcomes, and observed completion timing
are derived from workflow-job and recent-close data already collected for the
Overview page.

Bay polls the Worker every 20 seconds, compared with Overview every 15 seconds:
three rather than four browser status requests per minute after initial load.
That is 25% fewer requests to the Worker, not a claim of 25% fewer GitHub API
calls. The existing 20-second server cache, snapshot age, edge location, and
other viewers determine when either page causes a GitHub refresh. In
particular, Bay's 20-second timer can align with cache expiry, so the demo does
not claim a lower upstream GitHub refresh rate than Overview.

The displayed end-to-end timing is an observed sample of the latest completed
jobs found in the previous hour, not a complete one-hour census. Per-lane wait
times are not shown because the current data cannot support them accurately.

## Assets And Deployment

The page, status API, and image assets all belong to `time-attack/clawsweeper`:

- `dashboard/bay-page.ts` renders the page.
- `dashboard/worker.ts` serves `/bay-demo` and derives the bounded Bay state.
- `dashboard/public/bay-assets/` contains the three WebP assets.
- `dashboard/wrangler.toml` binds that public asset directory.
- `.github/workflows/dashboard.yml` deploys the existing
  `clawsweeper-status` Worker to `clawsweeper.openclaw.ai`.

The demo HTML is `no-store`, `noindex`, frame-blocked, and protected by a
content security policy. `/bay` remains unpublished so this experiment is not
mistaken for a permanent dashboard route.

## Local Proof

Start the Worker:

```bash
pnpm run dashboard:dev
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8787/bay-demo>. When local GitHub telemetry is
unavailable, the localhost page may read the existing public, cache-backed
production status snapshot for visual proof. The hosted page remains
same-origin in its request behavior; the CSP allows only self and OpenClaw
HTTPS subdomains so Wrangler's localhost preview can reach that production
snapshot.

The deployment smoke test also checks the demo route, security headers,
unpublished `/bay` route, and all three WebP assets:

```bash
pnpm run dashboard:smoke -- http://127.0.0.1:8787
```
