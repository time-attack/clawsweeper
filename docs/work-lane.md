# Work Lane

ClawSweeper reviews remain proposal-only. A review may now mark an open item as
a `queue_fix_pr` work candidate when the report looks valid, narrow, and safe
for a single ClawSweeper repair PR.

Reports store the lane fields in frontmatter:

- `item_category`
- `reproduction_status` and `reproduction_confidence`
- `requires_new_feature`, `requires_new_config_option`, and
  `requires_product_decision`
- `vision_fit`, `vision_fit_evidence`, and `implementation_complexity`
- `auto_implementation_candidate`: `none`, `strict_bug`, or `vision_fit`
- `work_candidate`: `none`, `manual_review`, or `queue_fix_pr`
- `work_status`: `none`, `manual_review`, or `candidate`
- `work_priority` and `work_confidence`
- `work_cluster_refs`, `work_validation`, and `work_likely_files`

The dashboard shows fresh `queue_fix_pr` reports whose `work_status` is
`candidate`. For `openclaw/openclaw` and `openclaw/clawhub`, this remains a
manual promotion queue. For other configured projects, complete
high-confidence candidates automatically enter the existing issue
implementation workflow after the safety gates below pass. For each fresh
candidate, apply/reconcile also generates
`records/<repo-slug>/plans/<number>.md` from the existing report fields. The
dashboard links both the source report and the generated coding plan so
maintainers can promote from a concise implementation view without editing the
durable report.

For open issues with complete, current kept-open reviews, apply/comment-sync
also projects a small owned set of advisory GitHub labels from the same
structured fields. Comments explain the evidence; labels expose routing state
for GitHub issue lists, searches, and project views. These labels do not
dispatch repair, merge, or close work, and they do not replace maintainer-owned
action labels such as `clawsweeper:autofix` or `clawsweeper:automerge`.
Failed or stale reports are skipped so outdated review conclusions do not mutate
live issue labels.
Close proposals are not label-mutated during apply, so advisory label writes do
not advance an issue's `updated_at` before close eligibility gates have finished.
When ClawSweeper does sync labels, the report frontmatter records
`labels_synced_at`. The scheduler treats `updated_at` values up to that timestamp
as ClawSweeper-owned churn, similar to durable review comment syncs, so a
label-only apply pass does not immediately queue another review of the same item.

When the advisory sync marks an issue `clawsweeper:queueable-fix`, it also adds
the target repository's durable `no-stale` exemption and removes an existing
`stale` label. Lower-confidence, manual-review, or otherwise non-queueable
advisory states do not receive stale protection from this sync. If a later sync
clears an existing `clawsweeper:queueable-fix` advisory label, it also clears
the `no-stale` exemption added for that queueable state; existing `no-stale`
labels without prior queueable advisory state are preserved as unrelated labels.

Except for that queueable-issue stale transition, the advisory-label sync owns
only the `clawsweeper:*` and issue-rating labels in this group. Reruns add labels
that match the latest report, remove stale labels from the owned group, and
preserve unrelated labels plus action/proof labels such as `good first issue`,
`clawsweeper:autofix`,
`clawsweeper:automerge`, `clawsweeper:human-review`,
`clawsweeper:merge-ready`, `proof: sufficient`, and
`mantis: telegram-visible-proof`.

`good first issue` uses GitHub's standard label name, color, and description.
ClawSweeper keeps the bar narrower than merely "small": the bug must reproduce
on current main with high confidence, fit one focused PR, include both a repair
prompt and validation steps, and require no new feature, config, product,
security, or protected-label decision. The label is add-only because GitHub does
not expose current-label ownership. A human removal in the GitHub label timeline
is treated as an opt-out; a later human re-add clears that opt-out.

Plan artifacts are generated state. They are removed when the item closes,
archives, becomes stale, or is reclassified away from `queue_fix_pr`; regenerate
them from the source report instead of editing them by hand.

## Automatic Issue Implementation

The automatic issue implementation lane is disabled for `openclaw/openclaw`
and `openclaw/clawhub`. In other eligible public `openclaw/*` and `steipete/*`
projects, newly reviewed issues and existing open issue reports can enter the
lane after a complete current review when
`CLAWSWEEPER_AUTO_IMPLEMENT_ISSUES=1`.

- open with a complete current report
- kept open with no close reason
- free of protected or security signals
- not already covered by an open PR or ClawSweeper implementation branch

The viable lane intentionally does not require the review to preselect files,
validation commands, implementation shape, confidence, or a repair prompt.
Codex receives the source issue and review context, inspects the repository,
chooses a narrow implementation strategy, discovers the repository's own
validation, and stops without opening a PR when the request is already fixed,
no longer useful, security-sensitive, or needs a maintainer product decision.
Deterministic code still owns repository exclusions, issue identity and state,
security/protected labels, opt-out labels, PR and cluster deduplication, branch
pushes, validation, PR creation, review, and merge gates.

Scheduled sweeps scan durable open issue reports and dispatch a bounded batch
per target repository. Existing durable issue jobs, generated PRs, and intake
receipts for the same report revision suppress duplicate intake. A newly
published report revision can retry a previously rejected issue.

The older strict bug lane remains available and can create a PR only for
reviewed issues that are exactly:

- `item_category: bug`
- `reproduction_status: reproduced`
- `reproduction_confidence: high`
- `auto_implementation_candidate: strict_bug` when the report has this newer
  field
- `work_candidate: queue_fix_pr`
- `work_confidence: high`
- `requires_new_feature: false`
- `requires_new_config_option: false`
- `requires_product_decision: false`

This intentionally excludes mixed feature/config/product work. If a fix would
add a flag, setting, new mode, provider support, broad UX behavior, dependency,
or maintainer policy choice, the review must not classify it as an automatic
bug implementation candidate.

The sibling vision-fit lane is opt-in with
`CLAWSWEEPER_AUTO_IMPLEMENT_VISION_FIT=1`. It may create a PR only for reviewed
issues that are exactly:

- `auto_implementation_candidate: vision_fit`
- `vision_fit: aligned`
- `implementation_complexity: small`
- `work_candidate: queue_fix_pr`
- `work_confidence: high`
- no security/protected signal
- no product-decision blocker
- complete repair prompt, likely files, validation commands, and VISION.md
  evidence

This lane allows small feature/docs/cleanup work when it fits `VISION.md`, but
still stops before broad product or architecture work. Medium-or-larger aligned
items remain manual work-lane candidates.

When enabled, strict-bug and vision-fit sweeps also scan durable open reports,
so their existing eligible issue backlog enters the same bounded intake.

After review publish, `sweep.yml` scans the just-produced artifacts and durable
open issue records, then dispatches
`repair-issue-implementation-intake.yml` for a bounded set of eligible reports.
The intake workflow re-fetches the live issue, rejects protected, security, or
locked items, skips issues that already have an open PR reference, durable
issue job, or existing ClawSweeper implementation PR, writes the normal
`source: issue_implementation` job, commits the ledger, then dispatches
`repair-cluster-worker.yml` in autonomous mode. Jobs use
`trigger_source: review_viable_issue`, `trigger_source:
review_reproducible_bug`, or `trigger_source: review_vision_fit` to preserve
which lane queued the PR.

Comment-triggered issue implementation uses the same durable job format. If a
worker starts before the new state commit is visible in its checkout, the worker
reconstructs the minimal `source: issue_implementation` job from the job path
and continues instead of treating the dispatch as stale.

PRs created from issue implementation are labeled `clawsweeper`,
`clawsweeper:autogenerated`, and `clawsweeper:autofix`, which enters the
existing bounded review/fix/re-review loop. A clean exact-head review waits for
required checks to appear and settle green, then removes the repair-loop label
and leaves the PR open for maintainer review and manual merge. Generated issue
PRs never automerge. The generated PR closes the source issue only through its
normal closing reference after a maintainer merges it.
When a worker opens the PR from a maintainer command, it edits the existing
ClawSweeper command status comment with the generated PR link so the same
comment moves from queued to opened.

Automatic work also maintains one marker-backed status comment on the source
issue. It announces that ClawSweeper is building, updates through queued,
planning, building, complete, or blocked states, links the Actions run, and
lists the opt-out labels. The live dashboard groups those lifecycle events by
source issue and shows the issue title, current phase, active worker, run, and
generated PR.

Promote a candidate from this checkout:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/clawsweeper
pnpm run repair:create-job -- \
  --from-report records/openclaw-openclaw/items/123.md
pnpm run repair:validate-job -- jobs/openclaw/inbox/clawsweeper-openclaw-openclaw-123.md
```

Commit and push the generated job, then dispatch `mode: autonomous` when the
execution window is intentionally open. The repair lane checks for an existing
open PR/body match and the `clawsweeper/<cluster-id>` branch before creating a
duplicate job.
