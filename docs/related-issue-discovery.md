# Related Issue Discovery

ClawSweeper includes compact related issue and PR context in each review prompt so
the reviewer can spot duplicates, superseded work, adjacent reports, and already
active fix paths. This context is advisory. It gives the review model evidence;
it does not itself close issues, change labels, open PRs, or merge anything.

## Sources

Related item context is built from a small set of bounded sources:

- Explicit links in the item body, comments, timeline, PR body, and PR review
  comments, including `#123` references and same-repository GitHub issue or PR
  URLs.
- GitHub closing-PR references for issues, such as PRs that use `Fixes #123`.
- Existing local ClawSweeper reports with overlapping title terms.
- Optional local gitcrawl cluster data, when a gitcrawl SQLite database is
  available.
- Optional live GitHub issue search for exact event reviews.

The review prompt still requires a conservative canonical-search pass before
using `duplicate_or_superseded`. The related context is a starting point, not a
standalone duplicate verdict.

## Live GitHub Search

Live GitHub Search is intentionally opt-in because the Search API has tighter
rate limits than normal issue reads. Exact event reviews enable it by default in
the ClawSweeper workflow:

```text
CLAWSWEEPER_RELATED_GITHUB_SEARCH=1
```

Set `CLAWSWEEPER_RELATED_GITHUB_SEARCH=0` in repository variables to disable the
live search enrichment without changing code.

The search is issue-only, scoped to the target repository, and based on a small
set of non-generic title terms. Results are included in the prompt as candidate
related items so the reviewer can decide whether they are truly duplicates,
adjacent reports, or irrelevant matches.

## Gitcrawl

When a local gitcrawl database exists, ClawSweeper reads same-cluster issue
siblings from the same target repository as the reviewed issue and adds them to
the same related-item prompt section. ClawSweeper does not run a gitcrawl fetch
or download issues during review; it only reads an existing SQLite database.

Database lookup order is:

```text
CLAWSWEEPER_GITCRAWL_DB
../gitcrawl-store/data/<owner>__<repo>.sync.db
~/.config/gitcrawl/stores/gitcrawl-store/data/<owner>__<repo>.sync.db
~/.config/gitcrawl/gitcrawl.db
```

Use `CLAWSWEEPER_GITCRAWL_DB=/path/to/gitcrawl.db` to point at a different
database. If the database or `sqlite3` is unavailable, this source is skipped
silently and the review continues with the other context sources.

For portable gitcrawl-store checkouts, freshness is maintained by the store
workflow and by refreshing the local checkout, for example with
`git pull --ff-only` before a run. Both current portable gitcrawl tables and the
older legacy cluster tables are supported on a best-effort basis.

## Guardrails

- Related discovery does not create new labels.
- Related discovery does not auto-close an item by itself.
- Related discovery does not make repair or automerge decisions.
- Duplicate or superseded close proposals still require concrete evidence in
  the review and must pass the existing apply-time live-state checks.
- GitHub Search is enabled only for exact one-item event reviews by default, not
  broad scheduled sweeps.
